        DevFests are community-led, developer events hosted by GDG chapters around the globe focused on community building and learning about Googleâ€™s technologies. Each DevFest is inspired by and uniquely tailored to the needs of the developer community and region that hosts it.

          While no two DevFests will be exactly alike, each at its core is powered by a shared belief that when developers come together to exchange ideas, amazing things can happen.

          Devfests are events where we come together to learn from each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          The motive is to create a local ecosystem of Developers and give them a platform to Interact and Network. We talk about various cutting-edge technologies.
